# Weather Warden

## Introduction

The Weather Warden is a web application that provides users with up-to-date weather information for their desired location. This project is part of my journey to become a front-end web developer, and it incorporates APIs from OpenWeatherMap and Open-Meteo to fetch weather data and icons from Meteocons by Bas Milius to display the weather conditions.

* On page reload application retrives last search location and displays its current weather information.
